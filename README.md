#Code Challenge 

**Progressive Web App Offline Recipe Keeper:**

_**Concept:**_ Build a single-page app (SPA) that allows users to browse, save, and manage recipes, with a key twist: it should work both online and offline.

_**Features:**_

- User Interface & User Experience: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing recipes.
- Recipe browsing: Users can search and browse through a list of recipes provided by a public API or static data.
- Recipe saving: Users can save their favorite recipes for offline access. Saved recipes should be stored using Web Storage APIs like IndexedDB.
- Offline functionality: Saved recipes and basic functionalities should be accessible even when the user is offline. Consider caching images and recipe data using a service worker.
- Optional features:
- Recipe filtering and sorting based on dietary restrictions, ingredients, etc.
- Ingredient substitution suggestions.
- Shopping list creation based on saved recipes.
- User accounts and recipe sharing (requires online connectivity).

_**Technologies:**_

- Front-end framework: React, Vue.js, Angular, or plain JavaScript.
- Service workers: To cache data and enable offline functionality.
- Web Storage APIs: IndexedDB or Local Storage to store saved recipes.
- Public recipe API (optional): If you don't want to provide static data.

_**Bonus features:**_

- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Offline-first approach: prioritize storing data for offline use and gradually fetch missing information online when available.
